## Memory Book

### This is a collection of my old builds, 2020/2022, while simplistic, they were large building blocks for where I am today


### Wifis First Build


This was my first build, a basic tazer from a youtube tutorial.

This is one of my first builds with the raspberry pi, like most builds from this era, it used lots of copied repositorys and very little editing/coding of my own.


### Nerf Plasma Rifle

This is about what it sounds, a preasurised tube of propane which would shoot out of a modified nerf barrel with a tazer ignition system. like a potato cannon with more flame.



### Cattle Prod

This was a big step for me as this was the first build i ever made without a tutorial. Later turned into the *eletric* Guitar which tazed people. (no documentation)
