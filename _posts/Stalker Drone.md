### Stalker Drone For Missing Persons


The general design around this drone is a ISMI number catcher/ GSM signal emmiter attached to its chasis. 

The main concept is, everyone has a phone on them nowadays, especailly hikers and campers. When these people get lost without service, it can seem that all the help of their phone is lost. This drone will fix that.

GSM signals are constantly caught and resent by cellular devices, This is the same repeating signal that gives you the 1-4 bars of signal displayed.

This Device flys over a premapped area of land by the search party. This area would idealy have little to no other signal from other towers.

The low powered GSM emmiter would catch and record ISMI numbers it flys over in a small radius depending on the power chosen by the party.

As it catches ISMI numbers flying over its path, it will record the time in its preplanned route, This would allow the Search Party to narrow down the location of the missing person drasticly.
