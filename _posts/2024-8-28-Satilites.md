# Satilites Imagry and My Journy
### Below is a section of photos documenting my Journey working with NOAA satilites. I could talk for hours about how all of this works. however that doesnt make for a good post so ill save that for a later video.

## my first sucsessfull satilite image, NOAA-18 APT signal on a simple Dipole on 137mhz

## An APT antenna made from trash around a campsite, connected to the russian Meteor M-2 satilites
#### the images taken with this, while extremely clear and data rich, were sadly lost in a small explosion.

## My APT journey while shortlived introduced me to the basics of satilites, signals, and radio systems. It is now a staple of my camping kit to build materials to build a APT antenna with little kids.

# Geostationary Satilites
These satilites are the big dogs of weather satilites. HRIT and GRB signals have high bandwith and can transfer large ammounts of data. So far i have been working on L band HRIT signals. (because my dad doesnt want a huge C band antenna in the backyard) >:/ currently building one anyways ;)
